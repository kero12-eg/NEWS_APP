## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kero12-eg/news_app.git
```

### 2. Open the Project Folder

```bash
cd news_app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Configure the API Key

The application uses a news API to retrieve headlines and search results.

Add your API key to the appropriate API service configuration in the project.

Example:

```dart
const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your valid API key and make sure the key is configured according to the API provider's requirements.

**Important:** Do not commit private API keys to a public repository.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
flutter run
```

Make sure Flutter is installed and an Android emulator or a physical device is configured.

## 🔌 API Integration

The application communicates with a REST API to retrieve news articles and display them dynamically in the interface.

API integration is used to support the main news browsing and search experiences, allowing users to explore available headlines and find articles related to their search queries.

The networking layer is organized separately from the UI, helping keep API communication and screen presentation easier to maintain.

The actual API provider, available endpoints, and required authentication depend on the API configuration used by the project.

## 🖼️ Application Screens

### Home Screen

The home screen provides access to the latest news headlines and available categories. Users can browse articles and discover news across different topics through an organized interface.

### Search Screen

The search screen allows users to enter keywords and find news articles related to their interests. It provides a dedicated interface for searching without relying exclusively on the main news feed.

### English Search Results

The English search results screen displays news articles matching an English search query. Each result can include an article title, image, author, and publication date, depending on the information returned by the API.

### Arabic Search Results

The Arabic search results screen supports searching with Arabic keywords and displaying the corresponding news articles. This provides an additional way for users to explore news in their preferred language.
